# CREWAI-Project-with-Google-Generative-AI-Integration
This project demonstrates the integration of the CREWAI framework with Google's Generative AI to automate customer service responses. The system consists of multiple agents, each responsible for handling specific tasks and inquiries. The agents work together to receive user input, process it, and provide accurate and relevant responses.
